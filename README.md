# succosim_allegro_tile

This is a clone of the [**succosim** repository](https://github.com/mattiasoldani/succosim), customised for the design optimisation of different elements of the FCC*ee* ALLEGRO Tile Calorimeter &mdash; most notably, the study is focussed on the shape of the individual active tiles/cells, on the features of the light transport and collection to the photodetection system, on the response to different particle beams, etcetera. It can be downloaded either as a ZIP archive, from the Code drop-down menu [here](https://github.com/mattiasoldani/succosim_allegro_tile), or directly from the terminal (open in your project working directory) via
```shell
git clone https://github.com/mattiasoldani/succosim_allegro_tile.git
```
Further details can be found in the [original project page](https://github.com/mattiasoldani/succosim).
